# POLICY EVALUATION

## AIM
To develop a Python program to evaluate the given policy.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The bandit slippery walk problem is a reinforcement learning problem in which an agent must learn to navigate a 7-state environment in order to reach a goal state. The environment is slippery, so the agent has a chance of moving in the opposite direction of the action it takes.

### States

The environment has 7 states:
* Two Terminal States: **G**: The goal state & **H**: A hole state.
* Five Transition states / Non-terminal States including  **S**: The starting state.

### Actions

The agent can take two actions:

* R: Move right.
* L: Move left.

### Transition Probabilities

The transition probabilities for each action are as follows:

* **50%** chance that the agent moves in the intended direction.
* **33.33%** chance that the agent stays in its current state.
* **16.66%** chance that the agent moves in the opposite direction.

For example, if the agent is in state S and takes the "R" action, then there is a 50% chance that it will move to state 4, a 33.33% chance that it will stay in state S, and a 16.66% chance that it will move to state 2.

### Rewards

The agent receives a reward of +1 for reaching the goal state (G). The agent receives a reward of 0 for all other states.

```py
def policy_evaluation(pi, P, gamma=1.0, theta=1e-10):
   	'''Initialize 1st Iteration estimates of state-value function(V) to zero'''
    prev_V = np.zeros(len(P), dtype=np.float64)

    while True:
        '''Initialize the current iteration estimates to zero'''
        V=np.zeros(len(P),dtype=np.float64)
        
        for s in range(len(P)):
        
            '''Update the value function for each state'''
            for prob,next_state,reward,done in P[s][pi(s)]:
                V[s] += prob * (reward + gamma * prev_V[next_state] * (not done))
                
            '''Check for convergence'''
            if np.max(np.abs(prev_V-V))<theta:
                break
                
            '''Update the previous state-value function'''
            prev_V=V.copy()
        return V
```

## OUTPUT:
### Policy 1
```
Policy:
|           | 01      < | 02      < | 03      < | 04      < | 05      < |           |

State-value function:
|           | 01 0.00246 | 02   0.01 | 03 0.03322 | 04 0.10489 | 05 0.32625 |           |

```

### Policy 2
```
Policy:
|           | 01      > | 02      < | 03      > | 04      < | 05      > |           |

State-value function:
|           | 01   0.25 | 02 0.33333 | 03 0.58333 | 04 0.66667 | 05 0.91667 |           |
```

### Comparison:
```
